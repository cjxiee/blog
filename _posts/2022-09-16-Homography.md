## Homography cooridnate in the computer vision
Homogenous Coordinates are a system of coordinates used in the projective space. 

The projective space can be imagined as a plane located at Z = 1 in the 3D space.
Lines that cut through the origin of the 3D space and intersect the Z = 1 plane form points in the projective space.


A line is a plane of rays through origin.
(a,b,c) is a normal vector to the plane.
